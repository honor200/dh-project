# Neural Style Transfer on different depictions of The Last Supper
## Description
This project is part of my Master's degree in Data Science (Digital Humanities). It involves applying Neural Style Transfer on different depictions of The Last Supper . The aim of the project is to combine the styles of three versions of the Last Supper, and the content of da Vinci's painting, in three unique images, to analyse the effect of the artists' personal technique on their paintings.
